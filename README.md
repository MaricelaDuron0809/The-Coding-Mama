<h1>The Coding Mama </h1>
A reddit like platfrom created for moms in tech to vent about anything and everything. 
As a mom trying to get into tech I have encounetred some challenges that not everyone can relate to. 
I created a safe space for moms to vent without the fear of getting judged or feeling like they've shared too much.
Mamas can create an account with an alias an no one will know who they really are so they can just vent away and go on with their lives feeling a sense of relief.
